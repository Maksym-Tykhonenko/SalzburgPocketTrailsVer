Hidden doorways and walled-up arches still hint at secret workshops. One tale tells of a reclusive alchemist who vanished after allegedly discovering the “fifth element.” Centuries later, his workshop was rediscovered during renovations—sealed and untouched, with strange symbols etched into the walls. Steingasse isn’t just a passage—it’s a preserved memory of a Salzburg that whispered before it sang.'
